Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.

For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

First, create a Hat class in prob_calculator.py. The class should take a variable number of arguments that specify the number of balls of each color that are in the hat.

The Hat class should have a draw method that accepts an argument indicating the number of balls to draw from the hat. This method should remove balls at random from contents and return those balls as a list of strings. The balls should not go back into the hat during the draw, similar to an urn experiment without replacement. If the number of balls to draw exceeds the available quantity, return all the balls.

Next, create an experiment function in prob_calculator.py (not inside the Hat class).

For example, if you want to determine the probability of getting at least two red balls and one green ball when you draw five balls from a hat containing six black, four red, and three green. To do this, you will perform N experiments, count how many times M you get at least two red balls and one green ball, and estimate the probability as M/N. Each experiment consists of starting with a hat containing the specified balls, drawing several balls, and checking if you got the balls you were attempting to draw.
